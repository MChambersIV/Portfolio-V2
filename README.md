# portfolio-t2
This is my second crack at a professional personal portfolio. I have slightly more skill under my wing, and while I have a ways to go. This was a good place to to revisit it.

I have included several projects I've worked on thus far that I am pretty happy with that also showcase some of what I've learned.
Each has a section has a screen of the project's page on load and a link to it's respective repository.

##
I've included a Contact Me section at the bottom of the page so anyone interested in reaching out to me can.
Conceptually, at least. I feel I have a ways to go before I'm ready to be reached out to so I've just created to some placeholders in the real information's stead.
